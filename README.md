# ChessMaster

As a beginner to intermediate chess player, I want insights into my favorite player’s opening tactics so that I can practice them and improve my game.

Built for Chess players that want to take their game to the next level. Search for your favorite players, take a glimpse into their most recent openings, then practice those openings all in one place.

We utilized 3 API’s; one for the accessing Chess.com’s extensive player database, one giving us access to a blank chessboard, and lastly an API that allowed us to populate the chessboard with movable pieces. We decided to use Foundation as a means to aid improve the style and functionality of our CSS.
